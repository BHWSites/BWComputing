<h3 class="Subheader">Thinking Abstractly</h3><br>
<div> Abstract thinking is solving problems by drawing logical conclusions from a set of observations, and by making hypotheses and testing them. </div>
<br>
<div>Abstraction is needed because it helps you to focus on the relevant and important information by completely blocking out the information that you don't need.
it can also provide a helpful overview of the information, helping you to see a problem more clearly. It helps you to manage complexity, and separate 
relevant and irrelevant details. Abstraction is the removal of unnecessary details, as opposed to viewing the reality, where everything is included.</div><br><br>
